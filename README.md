# OrbitalSimulator
OrbitalSimulator is a physics simulation for non-relativistic astromechanics

## Features - TO DO
This programme shall one day fulfill the following requirements.  
1. Implement Newtonian point particle mechanics.
2. Simulate orbits of objects with negligible mass around configurations of massive, fixed bodies.
3. ... around configurations of massive bodies which themselves orbit another object of even greater mass.
4. Simulate the effects of orbital maneuvers for said objects of negligible mass.

Moreover, the programme shall implement a variety of features to achieve the aforementioned criteria.
